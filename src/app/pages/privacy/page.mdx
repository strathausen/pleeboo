# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 2024*

## Your Privacy Matters

At Pleeboo, we believe in radical simplicity - and that extends to our privacy practices. We collect the absolute minimum information needed to run the service, and we never sell your data.

## What We Collect

### When You Create a Board

- **Board content**: Event titles, descriptions, and pledge items
- **Optional user info**: If you're signed in, we associate the board with your account
- **Timestamps**: When boards are created and modified

### When You Pledge

- **Your name**: Only what you choose to enter
- **Pledge details**: What you're contributing
- **No email or phone required**: We don't need it, so we don't ask for it

### Automatically Collected

- **Basic analytics**: Page views and general usage patterns (anonymized)
- **Error logs**: To fix bugs and improve the service
- **No tracking cookies**: We don't follow you around the web

## What We Don't Collect

- Personal information you don't explicitly provide
- Behavioral tracking data
- Third-party advertising data

### How Long We Keep It

- **Active boards**: As long as they're being used
- **Inactive boards**: Automatically deleted after 6 months of inactivity

## Your Rights

### You Can Always:

- **Access your data**: See everything we have about you
- **Delete your data**: Remove boards or your entire account

Each service is chosen for their commitment to privacy and security.

## Children's Privacy

Pleeboo is designed to be safe for all ages. We don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 beyond what they choose to enter as pledge names.

## Data Breaches

If a breach occurs:

1. We'll fix the vulnerability immediately
2. Assess what (if any) data was affected
3. Notify affected users within 72 hours
4. Work with authorities as required
