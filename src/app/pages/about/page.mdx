    <strong>Pleeboo</strong> is the simplest way to organize community events and coordinate volunteers. We believe that bringing people together shouldn't require complicated software, lengthy sign-ups, or expensive subscriptions.

## Our Mission

Making community organizing simple, free, and accessible to everyone.

## Why We Built This

Have you ever tried to organize a neighborhood potluck using a spreadsheet? Or coordinated volunteers for a school fundraiser through endless email chains? We have, and it was painful.

That's why we created Pleeboo - a dead-simple pledge board that:

- **Works instantly** - No sign-ups, no downloads, no hassle
- **Shares easily** - One link is all you need
- **Updates in real-time** - Everyone sees the latest status
- **Costs nothing** - Free forever, no hidden fees

## How It Works

### 1. Create Your Board
Give your event a name and description. Our AI assistant can even suggest common items and volunteers you might need based on your event type.

### 2. Share the Link
Send one simple link to your community via email, text, or social media. That's it.

### 3. Watch It Fill Up
Community members can pledge items or volunteer for tasks with just their name. No accounts needed.

## Our Values

### 🌟 Simplicity First
If a feature makes things complicated, we don't add it. Every decision is filtered through the lens of simplicity.

### 🤝 Community Driven
We're building this for real communities, not corporations. Your neighborhood potluck is as important to us as any large event.

### 🎯 Privacy Focused
We don't track users, sell data, or require personal information. Your event details stay yours.

### 💚 Forever Free
Community organizing should be accessible to everyone. Pleeboo will always have a generous free tier that works for most events.

## Get Involved

### Use Pleeboo for Your Next Event
The best way to support us is to use Pleeboo and tell your friends about it.
