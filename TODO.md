## next up
- support for amount (we need 5kg of dough, as many entries as needed...)
- support for human readable slug that is ignored (e.g. my-autumn-picnic/t-23094qqqq43prjw3oi4)
- review the pledge/volunteer entering debounce, does it always catch all changes?
- plus/minus is glitchy

## backlog
- move board ID to board code or something, and use the auto generated ID from
  the database to separate internal ID and external ID

- email your links
